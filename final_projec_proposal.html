			Game 1: Light
		</h1>

		<p>
		This game is a puzzle based game based on exploration.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Premise
		</h3>

		<p>
		The ISS Shunya has been sent to explore a derelict and ancient ship. Your crew is the prized jewel of the federation.
		Your sensors have shown that there are no living organisms onboard and it seems the environment inside is habitable.
		Your captain has asked the away team to take a look. And so here you are.
		</p>

		<p>
		This can also be something like an ancient computer that worked on optics left behind by the antarctic civilization under their pyramids.
		I can see some story line propagation using Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Mechanics
		</h3>

		<p>
		The game will have a lot of light sources and lots of mirrors, refractors, filters, light sources, etc.
		that will be used to open doorways, highlight hidden passageways, reveal information.
